# dumpdisc
A library and tools to verify and dump CDROM images

Currently Apple HFS and plain ISO 9660 filesystems are supported with plan to add support for Joilet, UDF, Rockridge and Apple HFS+ and also support for GPT partitions.

The library usage is very simple. Please read the tools code ([extract](extract.py), [tree](tree.py) and [dump](dump.py)) as examples on how to use it.
